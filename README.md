cd <your-repo-name>
```


## 2. Install Dependencies

# üìã API Endpoints

## 1. Generate Short URL
   
POST /short-url
```bash
Request Body:

{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}


Response:

{
  "id": "shortid123"
}

```
## 2. Redirect to Original URL

GET /short-url/:shortId

Example: Visiting http://localhost:3000/short-url/shortid123 redirects to the original URL



#Testing with Postman

## Step 1: Install Postman

Download and install Postman from Postman's official website.


## Step 2: Test the API

### a. Generate a Short URL

Open Postman and create a POST request.

Set the endpoint to: http://localhost:3000/short-url.

Go to the Body tab, select raw, and set the format to JSON.

Add the following JSON:
``` bash
Copy code
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```
Click Send to receive a response like:
```bash
Copy code
{
  "id": "shortId123"
}
```
### b. Test the Redirect

Create a GET request in Postman.

Set the endpoint to: http://localhost:3000/shortId123 (replace shortId123 with the ID from the previous step).

Click Send to observe the redirection or see the response.
